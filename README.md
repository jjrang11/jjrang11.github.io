# How the filters work
1. If all checkboxes are unchecked, map will show all restaurants.
2. If at least one checkbox is checked, map will show only checked categories.

# How the markers work
Click on marker to see info about the chosen restaurant.

# Ways to use "Get directions to here"
1. Choosing any location from the map first then choosing a restaurant to get directions from will give you direction from the chosen location. To clear the custom marker simply press the "Clear Custom Marker" button.
2. Directly choosing a restaurant will use your current location.

# How the draw works
Simply choose the circle draw in the top center portion of the map and drag to draw a circle. Number of markers will be shown on the side by the filters (it will show the latest circle drawn).
